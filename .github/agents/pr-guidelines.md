# Pull Request Guidelines for Copilot Agent

This document provides guidelines for the Copilot agent when creating pull requests for the varlock repository.

## Required Tasks for Feature PRs

When implementing a new feature or making significant changes, the PR should include:

### 1. Code Implementation
- Implement the feature with minimal, surgical changes
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Add appropriate error handling

### 2. Tests
- Add comprehensive test coverage for the new feature
- Ensure all existing tests still pass
- Test edge cases and error scenarios

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Update relevant documentation in `packages/varlock-website/src/content/docs/`
- Add examples showing how to use the new feature
- Update reference documentation if adding new decorators, functions, or parameters
- Common documentation files to update:
  - `/guides/*.mdx` - Feature guides and tutorials
  - `/reference/*.mdx` - API reference documentation

### 4. Changeset
- **Always** create a changeset file in `.changeset/` directory
- Use semantic versioning: `minor` for new features, `patch` for bug fixes, `major` for breaking changes
- Include clear description of the changes, but keep it short
- Format: Create a new `.md` file in `.changeset/` with:
  ```markdown
  ---
  "varlock": <minor|patch|major>
  ---
  
  Brief description of the change
  (or use bullet list for multiple changes)
- An empty changeset is needed for changes that do not affect any published packages
  ```markdown
  ---
  ---
  ```

### 5. Code Review
- Run `bun run lint:fix` and then resolve remaining lint errors
- Run the code review tool before finalizing
- Address any feedback from automated reviews

### 6. Security Checks
- Run CodeQL security scanner
- Fix any discovered vulnerabilities
- Include security summary in PR

## Additional Requirements for `.NET` Initiative PRs

When a PR implements or proves work from `docs/proposals/dotnet-support.md`, it must also:

1. Cite the exact proposal sections touched.
2. Cite the affected IDs from `docs/proposals/dotnet-support-ledger.yml`.
3. State which phase and workstream owner the PR advances.
4. Identify which support claims, proof artifacts, example apps, automated tests, and docs are being added or moved forward.
5. Update `docs/proposals/dotnet-support-ledger.yml` whenever proof status, caveats, or deferrals change.
6. Avoid marking a `.NET` support claim as proven until the linked example and automated test exist, or the ledger explicitly records why one proof form is not applicable.

Use the repository PR template to capture this traceability in every `.NET` initiative PR.

## Changeset Commands

Available commands (defined in root `package.json`):
- `bun run changeset:add` - Interactively create a changeset (not available in CI)
- `bun run changeset:version` - Bundle changesets into version bumps
- `bun run changeset:publish` - Publish packages to npm

## Documentation Structure

The documentation website is in `packages/varlock-website/`:
- `src/content/docs/guides/` - Feature guides and how-tos
- `src/content/docs/reference/` - API reference documentation
- `src/content/docs/integrations/` - Integration guides

When updating documentation:
- Use proper markdown/MDX formatting
- Include code examples with syntax highlighting
- Link to related documentation using relative paths
- Keep examples concise and focused

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ❌ Don't commit test files or temporary files
2. ❌ Don't skip creating a changeset for changes to published packages
3. ❌ Don't forget to update documentation when adding new features
4. ❌ Don't leave empty commits or unnecessary files in the PR
5. ❌ Don't forget to run tests after making changes
